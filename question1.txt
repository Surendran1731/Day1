1)Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that is, currently, the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
HTTP is based on the Client/Server model. Client/Server model can be explained as two computers, Client (receiver of service) and Server 
(provider of service) that are communicating via requests and responses.

An example would be a restaurant guest and a waiter. The guest (Client) asks (sends request) the waiter (Server) for a meal, then the waiter gets the meal
from the restaurant chef (your application logic) and brings the meal to the guest.

HTTP/2
	In 2015, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) released HTTP/2, the second major version of the most useful Internet protocol, HTTP. It was derived from the 
earlier experimental SPDY protocol.
Main goals of developing HTTP/2:
1)Protocol negotiation mechanism — protocol electing, eg. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or other.
2)High-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1 — methods, status codes, URIs and header fields.
3)Page load speed improvements trough:
4)Compression of request headers
5)Binary protocol
6)HTTP/2 Server Push
7)Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
8)Request pipelining

Request multiplexing
	HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection. 
Header compression
	HTTP/2 compresses a large number of redundant header frames. 
Binary protocol
The latest HTTP version has evolved significantly in terms of capabilities and attributes such as transforming from a text protocol to a binary protocol.
